        <h1>About us</h1>
        <div class="us">
          <p>
            A nursery is a place where plants are propagated and grown to a
            desired age. Mostly the plants concerned are for gardening, forestry
            or conservation biology, rather than agriculture. They include
            retail nurseries, which sell to the general public, wholesale
            nurseries, which sell only to businesses such as other nurseries and
            to commercial gardeners, and private nurseries, which supply the
            needs of institutions or private estates. Some will also work in
            plant breeding. Nurseries often grow plants in a greenhouse, a
            building of glass or in plastic tunnels, designed to protect young
            plants from harsh weather while allowing access to light and
            ventilation. Modern greenhouses allow automated control of
            temperature, ventilation and light and semi-automated watering and
            feeding. A nursery customer could be a home gardener, landscape
            gardener or even a commercial farmer. A nursery business must cater
            a wide range of plants that would be indoor to outdoor plants and
            container to earth planting plants. Apart from plants, the nurseries
            must have to have the ability to assist in all kinds of inquiries
            and purchases.

          <h2>Our Mission</h2>
          <p>
            Our Mission is to make a website -"Kite". Kite was designed keeping
            in mind user requirements and the problems faced. It is a website
            for buying not just plants but also seeds, fertilizers and pots
            online. Information about plants is provided on the website and thus
            it could also be used for learning more about plants. Users can add
            product to cart and purchase them. Further a product tracking system
            is added so that buyers can locate their product.With the increased
            usage of the internet for day-to-day activities customers prefer
            buying everything online and saving their time. Moreover online
            shopping gives variety of options and also helps small businesses
            grow. We aim to connect buyers to the farmers and help them This
            project explores the world of farming and having your own nursery .
          </p>
          <br /><br />
          <h2>Our Vision</h2>
          <p>
            Website aims to connect user to nearby nursery stores which ensures
            faster deliveries and good quality products. This not only helps the
            buyer but also profits small businesses and farmers sell their
            products.Website also provides information about various plants to
            save the users time which is otherwise wasted in doing research. It
            can be accessed all over the internet and the user friendly UI can
            be easily understood by anyone interested in buying and
            selling.Since multiple retailers will do business on the site , it
            will help buyer to compare the prices of same product in one place.
