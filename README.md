###KITE-Online Nursery
Be it a cozy studio apartment, a sprawling mansion, or an office filled with rows of cubicles, plants tend to brighten and liven up any room. With growing pollution and decreasing  greenery it has become the need of the hour to address this problem and do our part to make  this planet a better place for us and our future generations. Nature will always find its way to  survive, and itâ€™s our only hope.  
Kite was designed keeping in mind user requirements and the problems faced. It is a website  for buying not just plants but also seeds, fertilizers and pots online. Information about plants  is provided on the website and thus it could also be used for learning more about plants. Users can add product to cart and purchase them.
